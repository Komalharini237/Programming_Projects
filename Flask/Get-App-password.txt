Here's how you can enable 2FA and generate an App Password for your Google account:

* Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
- Go to your Google Account settings: Google Account - Security
- In the "Signing in to Google" section, select "2-Step Verification."
- Follow the prompts to set up 2FA for your account. This usually involves adding a second verification method, such as a phone number where you'll receive verification codes.

* Generate an App Password:
- Once 2FA is enabled, go to 2-Step Verification, scroll till "App passwords"  
- Under "App passwords," give "App name" like "Flask-Mail."
- Click "Create" to generate the app password.
- Copy the generated app password (a 16-character code).
- Use this app password as the MAIL_PASSWORD in your Flask configuration instead of your regular Google account password.
