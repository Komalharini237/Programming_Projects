Dataset Columns Explained:
- Patient_ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
- Age: Patient age.
- Weight: Patient weight.
- Disease_Status: Whether the patient has cancer (can be binary: "Cancer" or "Healthy").
- Gene1_Expression, Gene2_Expression, Gene3_Expression: Gene expression levels that could be relevant to the patientâ€™s disease status.
- Protein_Descriptor1, Protein_Descriptor2: Simplified numerical descriptors for protein structure related to drug interaction.
- Drug_Response: Indicates whether a drug was "Effective" or "Ineffective" for the patient.
- Drug_Dosage: Recommended drug dosage based on patient characteristics.


Project Walkthrough:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze the distribution of patient age, weight, gene expression levels, and protein descriptors.
- Identify correlations between gene expression, protein descriptors, and drug response/dosage.
2. Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values if any (in this case, there are none).
- Encode categorical columns like Disease_Status and Drug_Response using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. Model Building:
- Linear Regression: Predict drug dosage based on patient characteristics like age, weight, and gene expression.
- Decision Tree: Classify the disease status (Healthy or Cancer) based on genomic data (gene expressions).
- Random Forest: Predict which drugs will be effective based on protein structures and gene expression.
- k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors): Classify new proteins or patients based on similarity to known protein/gene profiles.
- SVM (Support Vector Machine): Differentiate between healthy and diseased gene expressions.
- K-Means Clustering: Group patients based on genetic profiles to identify patterns for personalized medicine.
4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall for classification tasks (Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared for regression tasks (Linear Regression).
5. Conclusion:
- Summarize insights from the analysis, like which model performed the best and how the data relates to real-world applications.
